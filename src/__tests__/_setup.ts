/**
 * Default vitest setup — runs once per test file.
 *
 * The quest-game flow code reaches the bot through `runtime()` (see
 * `flow/runtime.ts`). Tests that exercise stages bring their own
 * captured-call fake via `_harness.ts`; tests that DON'T touch the
 * flow (pure roles/state/vision tests) shouldn't have to set anything
 * up to use `t()`. So this setup file:
 *
 *  1. Wires a "throws on use" placeholder runtime — flow code that
 *     accidentally fires during a unit test surfaces loudly.
 *  2. Provides nothing else by default; integration tests opt in to a
 *     real fake via `installFakeRuntime()` from `_harness.ts`.
 *
 * Each test file resets module state to keep cross-file pollution out.
