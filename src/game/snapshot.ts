/**
 * Per-viewer game snapshot — the JSON the WebUI game board renders.
 *
 * This is the single security boundary for the WebUI: it is built
 * once per viewer and decides exactly what that viewer is allowed to
 * know. The rules:
 *
 *  - A seated player sees their OWN role/faction, plus a vision
 *    marker for every other seat computed by `buildVision` (the same
 *    rulebook the in-channel deal-reveal uses) — never another
 *    seat's actual role.
 *  - A spectator (token holder who isn't seated) sees no roles, no
 *    factions and no vision markers at all.
 *  - Once the game has ended, every seat's role/faction is revealed
 *    to everyone — the in-channel ending board already does this.
 *
 * `events` is the public timeline and is safe for any viewer as-is
 * (see `events.ts`).
