/**
 * One entry in a game's history timeline — surfaced in the WebUI
 * sidebar.
 *
 * Every variant carries ONLY publicly-known information: the same
 * facts the Discord channel scrollback already shows once a stage
 * resolves. No hidden role / faction / private-ballot data lands
 * here — so the timeline is safe to hand to any viewer (seated
 * player or spectator) with no per-viewer filtering.
 *
 *  - `team-proposed`   the leader locked a mission roster (public).
 *  - `public-vote`     team-approval ballots — revealed publicly
 *                      in-game once everyone has voted.
 *  - `mission-result`  success/fail + the aggregate fail count only;
 *                      never who cast a fail ballot.
 *  - `lake-used`       who inspected whom — the revealed faction is
 *                      private to the holder and is NOT recorded.
 *  - `assassinate`     the assassin's pick + the target's now-public
 *                      role (the in-game board reveals it too).
 *  - `game-end`        winner + verdict reason.
