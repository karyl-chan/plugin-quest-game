/**
 * Best-effort cleanup of the active stage board when a game is being
 * force-stopped. Without this, `/quest-game stop` (and the WebUI
 * force-stop) leaves the previous stage's message in the channel with
 * live-looking buttons — players click them and get
 * `error.notRunning` ephemerals, which is confusing UX.
 *
 * Strips buttons (components: []) so the embed body stays for
 * scrollback but the buttons go grey. Failures are swallowed: the
 * caller is about to remove the in-memory state anyway, and we
 * shouldn't surface RPC blips on a stop path.
